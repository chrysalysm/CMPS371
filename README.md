CMPS371
=======

All my programming work, assignments and exam projects from CMPS371 (Assembly Language) are gathered here in this git repo.  The syntax used in my programs/projects follow Intel's syntax and not AT&T's syntax, thus the files will not compile under a GCC compiler.  I personally feel Intel's syntax is easier to follow and understand.
